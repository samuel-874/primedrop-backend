        ##REG FLOW ->
        user enters email
        new user is created with email
        emailVerfiied is set to false by default
        jwt that expires in 40mins is generated and the an email is sent to the users email


        after users click on the link to verify email emailVerified is set To trues

        the user is the redirected to page where registration is completed
        so the users details is coming via a route that contains the users email
         we thencheck if a user with that email exists, if the email is verified and if the user has gone through this process before
         we then send a verification code to users mobile number
         phoneNumVerified is set to false
         when the user verifies his mobile number we then set phoneNumVerified to true

//        TODO if user is the sender, the orderRequest form will request for the receiver's name and number
//        TODO else if user is the receiver, the orderRequest form will request for the sender's name and number
//        TODO finally if user is the intermediary, the orderRequest form will request for the sender's and receiver's name and number
